TO-DO:
* allow textmatrix to get a list of files instead of a
  directory (maybe add random sample function also with
  the optional parameter so that you can re-use the same
  sample?)
* add maxWordLength (FALSE für unendlich)
* error handling für leere files?
* error handling für leere vektoren?
* add dimcalc_fraction()
* upper and lower boundaries for global frequencies
* remove numbers as terms (Simon Lin)
* Add <XML> and <HTML> handling: automatically 
  skipping the tags. (Simon Lin)
* add phrasedetection to textvector function ("my phrase"),
  should not strip any special chars and should stay
  case sensitive (Neal Snider)
* add possibility to filter by minimum number of 
  documents, a term has to appear in:
     m = m[!rowSums(lw_bintf(m))==minGlobFreq,]
* add error handling for "no term" documents (leave out, give warning)
* eliminate query -> integrate into textmatrix
* vignettes for the paper
* bugfix of print.textmatrix() (bug appeared: 2nd of jan 2006, Claudia)
  Fix by: Jeff Verhulst, J&J Pharma R&D IM (2006)

DONE 2005-11-23:

* a lot of minor changes to make documentation better
* smaller code changes
* renamed core functions to lsa(), as.textmatrix(), fold_in()

DONE 2005-11-12:
* documentation refactured, added documentation for several new methods.
* remove meanmax.R (doesn't fit the package
* check query() to ensure it's working

DONE 2005-11-11:
* bugfix textmatrix to work properly with the vocabulary list!!!

DONE 2005-11-08:

    high-level functions:
    
       DONE * lsa_fold-in
       DONE * lsa
    
    refacturing:
    
       DONE * eliminate pseudo_docs
       DONE   -> integrate into textmatrix
       NOT POSSIBLE * connections
       DONE * summary, print methods
       DONE * rewrite "pseudo_docs" to table / factor?
       NOT POSSIBLE * in triples.r: With(environment, { bla })
       NOT POSSIBLE * getTriples: return list(S=S, P=P, O=O)

     m = m[!rowSums(lw_bintf(m))==minGlobFreq,]

* remove numbers as terms (Simon Lin)

    * added dimcalc_fraction()

    * added support to textmatrix() to run not only over directories, 
	  but also over a single file or a vector of files (or a mixed 
	  vector with files and directories)

    * added maxWordLength filtering

    * added maxDocFreq filtering

o   2005-11-23:

    * a lot of minor changes to make documentation better
	
    * smaller code changes
	
    * renamed core functions to lsa(), as.textmatrix(), fold_in()

o   2005-11-22:
	* chose NOT to integrate separator lines (would splash the handling!)
      changed summary.textmatrix from matrix to vector output

o   2005-11-12:

    * documentation refactured, added documentation for several new methods.
	
    * removed meanmax.R (doesn't fit the package)
	
    * checked query() to ensure it's working

o   2005-11-11:

    * bugfix of textmatrix() to work properly with the vocabulary list
	* textmatrix(): integrated the vocabulary order/sort functions...

o   2005-11-08:

    * added high-level functions:
	   
       * lsa_fold-in
	   
       * lsa
    
    * refacturing:
	
        * eliminated pseudo_docs
          -> integrate into textmatrix
	  
        * connections for textmatrix turned out to be impossible
		
        * summary method
		
	    * print method
		
        * rewrote "pseudo_docs" to table / factor
		
		* added vocabulary filter to textmatrix / textvector

		* getTriples: use of "return list(S=S, P=P, O=O)"
	      turned out impossible
    

o   2005-10-04: added nchar(..., type="chars") to count characters, not bytes

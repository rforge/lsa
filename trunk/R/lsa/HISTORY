  sample?)

* error handling für empty textvectors?

* upper and lower boundaries for global frequencies
* maybe IDF instead of frequency boundaries?

  documents, a term has to appear in:
     m = m[!rowSums(lw_bintf(m))==minGlobFreq,]

* remove numbers as terms (Simon Lin)

* Add <XML> and <HTML> handling: automatically 
  skipping the tags. (Simon Lin)

* add phrasedetection to textvector function ("my phrase"),
  should not strip any special chars and should stay

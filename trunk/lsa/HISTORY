Wishlist & Unresolved
---------------------

* error handling for empty files (no term docs)?
* error handling für empty textvectors?

* maybe GF*IDF boundaries instead of frequency 
  boundaries

* bugfix neccessary: textmatrix with controlled
  vocabulary fails if no term is left

* add phrase detection to textvector function ("my phrase"),
  should not strip any special chars and should stay
  case sensitive (Neal Snider, Stanford)

* generalise architecture with text-processing chain

* input document sanitizing routines or at least a
  testing environment that can tell which files will
  produce errors.

* corpora package: global weights should always come
  from the original textmatrix, especially when folding
  in additional texts (see essay scoring example).
  
* corpora package: should decide automatically whether
  it is a textfile, a directory, or a string.

Changes in 0.59
---------------

o   Fridolin Wild (2007-12-11)
	
	* bug fix (R crashed when calling lsa_corpus
	  demo): essay scoring demo now calls data
	  files to avoid this unicode problem (seems
	  to be a bug in R).
	
	* stopword lists converted to .rda data files
	
	* unicode bugfix in tests
	
	* unicode bugfix for german umlaut
	  conversion from html-entities in textvector()
	  
	* demo index readlines bugfix (two blank lines
	  added)
	
	* landauer demo: X was using dimcalc_share()
	  instead of dimcalc_raw()

o   Fridolin Wild (2007-11-28)

	* Dutch stopword list added (thanks to Marco Kalz,
	  Open University Netherlands)
	
	* UTF-8 support enforced in stopword list, package
	  description, textmatrix
	  
	* stemming bug fixed (stemming was _after_
	  filtering by controlled vocabulary)
	
	* testing routine added for one-term matrices
	
	* special characters cleaned in textvector()
	
	* Optimised support for Arabic buckwalter transliterations
	  (referring to the earlier request of Neal Snider, 
	  Stanford, below). Included the following characters
	  to 'be' alphanumerics: ' $ | _ - ~ > < & { } * `
	  
	* utf-8 conform umlaut replacement in textmatrix()
	
	* added warning for 'empty' files (empty after filtering)
	  to textvector()
	

Changes in 0.58
---------------

o   Fridolin Wild (2006-08-01)

    * added simple <XML> tag handling: tags are automatically
      removed (requested by Simon Lin, Northwestern @ Feb 23, 2006)

    * added arabic support for Buckwalter transliterations
	  (requested by Neal Snider, Stanford @ Feb 21, 2006)
	
	* changed textmatrix() / textvector() standard language 
	  to english

    * textmatrix can now automatically remove terms with only
	  numbers (requested by Simon Lin, Northwestern @ Feb 23, 2006)

    * extended special character stripping ('#', '+', ...)

    * added upper and lower boundaries for global frequencies

    * demo for essay scoring added
	
	* data set with essays (corpus.6) added


o   Fridolin Wild (2006-07-31)

    * added random sample function for corpus selection.
	  index can be returned to allow for re-use of the sample.

    * added dimcalc_fraction()

    * added support to textmatrix() to run not only over directories, 
	  but also over a single file or a vector of files (or a mixed 
	  vector with files and directories)

    * added maxWordLength filtering

    * added maxDocFreq filtering


o   Jeff Verhulst (2006-04-21)

--------------------------------------

o   2005-11-23:

    * a lot of minor changes to make documentation better
	
    * smaller code changes
	
    * renamed core functions to lsa(), as.textmatrix(), fold_in()

o   2005-11-22:
	* chose NOT to integrate separator lines (would splash the handling!)
      changed summary.textmatrix from matrix to vector output

o   2005-11-12:

    * documentation refactured, added documentation for several new methods.
	
    * removed meanmax.R (doesn't fit the package)
	
    * checked query() to ensure it's working

o   2005-11-11:

    * bugfix of textmatrix() to work properly with the vocabulary list
	* textmatrix(): integrated the vocabulary order/sort functions...

o   2005-11-08:

    * added high-level functions:
	   
       * lsa_fold-in
	   
       * lsa
    
    * refacturing:
	
        * eliminated pseudo_docs
          -> integrate into textmatrix
	  
        * connections for textmatrix turned out to be impossible
		
        * summary method
		
	    * print method
		
        * rewrote "pseudo_docs" to table / factor
		
		* added vocabulary filter to textmatrix / textvector
		
        * in triples.r: use of "With(environment, { bla })" 
	      turned out impossible
        
		* getTriples: use of "return list(S=S, P=P, O=O)"
	      turned out impossible
    

o   2005-10-04: added nchar(..., type="chars") to count characters, not bytes


Changes in 0.47

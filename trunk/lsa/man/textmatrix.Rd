\title{Textmatrix (Matrices)}
\description{
  Creates a document-term matrix from all textfiles in a given directory.
}
\usage{
textmatrix( mydir, stemming=FALSE, language="english",
   minWordLength=2, maxWordLength=FALSE, minDocFreq=1, 
   maxDocFreq=FALSE, minGlobFreq=FALSE, maxGlobFreq=FALSE, 
   stopwords=NULL, vocabulary=NULL, phrases=NULL, 
   removeXML=FALSE, removeNumbers=FALSE)
textvector( file, stemming=FALSE, language="english", 
   minWordLength=2, maxWordLength=FALSE, minDocFreq=1, 
   maxDocFreq=FALSE, stopwords=NULL, vocabulary=NULL, 
   phrases=NULL, removeXML=FALSE, removeNumbers=FALSE )
}
\arguments{
   \item{file}{filename (may include path).}
   \item{mydir}{the directory path (e.g., \code{"corpus/texts/"}); may be single files/directories or a vector of files/directories.}
   \item{stemming}{boolean indicating whether to reduce all terms to their wordstem.}
   \item{language}{specifies language for the stemming / stop-word-removal.}
   \item{minWordLength}{words with less than minWordLength characters will be ignored.}
   \item{maxWordLength}{words with more than maxWordLength characters will be ignored; per default set to \code{FALSE} to use no upper boundary.}
   \item{minDocFreq}{words of a document appearing less than minDocFreq within that document will be ignored.}
   \item{maxDocFreq}{words of a document appearing more often than maxDocFreq within that document will be ignored; per default set to \code{FALSE} to use no upper boundary for document frequencies.}
   \item{minGlobFreq}{words which appear in less than minGlobFreq documents will be ignored.}
   \item{maxGlobFreq}{words which appear in more than maxGlobFreq documents will be ignored.}
   \item{stopwords}{a stopword list that contains terms the will be ignored.}
   \item{vocabulary}{if specified, only words in this term list will be used for building the matrix (`controlled vocabulary').}
   \item{removeXML}{if set to \code{TRUE}, XML tags (elements, attributes, some special characters) will be removed.}
   \item{removeNumbers}{if set to \code{TRUE}, terms that consist only out of numbers will be removed.}
   \item{phrases}{not implemented, yet.}
}
\details{
  All documents in the specified directory are read and a matrix is composed.
  The matrix contains in every cell the exact number of appearances (i.e., the term frequency) 
  of every word for all documents. If specified, simple text preprocessing mechanisms
  are applied (stemming, stopword filtering, wordlength cutoffs).
  
  Stemming thereby uses Porter's snowball stemmer (from package \code{Snowball}).
  
  There are two stopword lists included (for english and for german), which
  are loaded on demand into the variables \code{stopwords_de} and 
  \code{stopwords_en}. They can be activated by calling \code{data(stopwords_de)}
  or \code{data(stopwords_en)}. Attention: the stopword lists have
  to be already loaded when \code{textmatrix()} is called.
  
  \code{textvector()} is a support function that creates a list of
  term-in-document occurrences.
  
  For every generated matrix, an own environment is added as an attribute which
  holds the triples that are stored by \code{setTriple()} and can be
  retrieved with \code{getTriple()}.
  
  If the language is set to "arabic", special characters for the Buckwalter 
  transliteration will be kept.
